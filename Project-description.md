## Introduction

This project consists of the development of a data mining (DM) case study. The description of the application is provided in a separate page that can be found in moodle.

Two tasks will be addressed in the project: a descriptive DM task and predictive DM task. The descriptive data mining task is left to the choice of students. The predictive data mining task is defined in the case study description. The development of the project should be guided by a suitable methodology. The choice of methodology is left to the students.

## Rules

*   The project will be developed by groups of 2 students.
*   There will be a single delivery, to be made according to the instructions below and on the date indicated in the plan. Additionally, the plan contains dates when other results are expected, in order to help students monitor the progress of their work.

## Grading

*   70% of the project grade will be assigned based on the materials submitted in moodle and the presentation.
*   the remaining 30% will be assigned based on the results on the predictive data mining task, as follows
    *   a maximum grade will be assigned to the best result
    *   a minimum grade will be assigned to the worst result
    *   the other grades will assigned using a linear progression in the interval between the minimum and maximum grades

## Presentation guidelines

The presentation will serve also as the report. On one hand his means that it must be prepared for a 10 min. talk so it must focus on the main issues of the project. On the other hand, it should also summarize all the work that was carried out, which means that additional information that cannot be presented in the 10 min. slot can be included as annexes to the presentation.  

Suggested organization:  

*   domain description (1 short slide, as everyone is working on the same domain)
*   exploratory data analysis: very short summary, focusing on the main findings (2 slides)
*   for each data mining problem (descriptive + predictive)

*   problem definition (1 slide)
*   data preparation: very short summary, focusing on the main operationsÂ  (1 slide)
*   experimental setup (1 slide)
*   results (1 slide)

*   conclusions, limitations and future work (1 slide)  

*   annexes
*   TOTAL: max 40 slides  

## Submission instructions

*   The predictions for the competition, will be submitted in Kaggle
*   The presentation as well as any files that are required to reproduce the results (data, code, etc), will be submitted in moodle.
